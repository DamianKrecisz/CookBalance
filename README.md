## Short description
Application with cooking recipes where you Can create menus and preparing a shopping list


## Technology stack 

**Frontend:** Angular

**UI component:** NG-ZORRO

**Backend:** Firebase

## Firebase description

- The entire database and website hosting use firebase services.
- All users can login and register with email/password and Google Account. Login with facebook is temporary turned off.

## Design assumption

The application is produced to improve skills in the Angular framework and Firebase.

 I focused mainly on <ins>functionality</ins> to be able to give the first utility version. In the future, I want to expand the application with new modules, including:
 - Calories and micronutrient counter
 - Users can share own recipes to other users
 - Opinions and ranking of recipes

## Short user pages description

### Login/register page

### User profile page
